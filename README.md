# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to review users that participate in the Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. Because of this, we are also analyzing if there is bias towards those that get paid for reviews.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

For this analysis, we are looking at reviews of luggage on Amazon.

## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
According to the analysis, there was a higher percent of non-vine 5-star review than if they were part of the Vine program. This shows that there is no bias (or not applicable) towards those that are paid to review the products. However, the sample size of those that were part of the Vine program is extremely small compared to those that were not part of the Vine program, which I think the sample size should be much greater to be able to compare results to the non-Vine program.

Additionally, I think we could run analysis on what the average rating was for both programs and see if it skewed higher for the vine program. We could try to see if those in the vine program did not want to seem biased but still wanted to give a good review with 4 stars because they were paid for it, vs the non-vine program average rating that have no incentive and will rate honestly.
